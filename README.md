`My Main Agenda:`

- In highway accident cases, a CCTV/dashcam/toll camera–based injury severity estimator automatically triggers an appropriate tiered emergency response.
YOLO detects vehicles and pedestrians, performs posture analysis (e.g., lying, convulsing), and identifies bleeding or unstable posture indicators.
It then combines this with vehicle speed estimation to infer the probable severity of the accident.
Based on this, the system immediately sends an EMS triage suggestion (BLS/ALS), recommends the nearest available ambulance, and indicates whether police or fire department assistance is required.
